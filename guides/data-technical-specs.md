# Data Technical Specifications

??? info "**Version 1.1.0** (updated 2026-02-09)"
    
    - Updated version of documentation to clarify new standards 
    - Serogrouping for meningococcus: Report only at the state/reporting jurisdiction level as reporting at smaller geographies would likely lead to data suppression; report separately from age.
    - Age Groups: Reported at the state/reporting jurisdiction level; Combined the <1 year age groups (currently 0-6 months and 6-12 months) for current diseases (measles, pertussis, meningococcus) into a single “<1 year” category.
    - Removed “YTD” value as a valid option for time_unit.
    - Removed monthly aggregations; only weekly aggregation of cases by MMWR week for all diseases.
    - New value uses implemented: `total`, `unknown`, `unspecified` have specified meaning and uses, `NA` is only valid if `geo_name = "international resident"`.

## Overview

This document provides the complete technical specifications for disease tracking data submissions to the US Disease Tracker system. These specifications define the required and optional fields, data types, valid values, and formatting requirements for submitting aggregate disease case count data.

**Important:** This is for aggregate data only. No line-level (individual case) data should be submitted.

**Note:** For high-level submission guidance including what data to submit, when to submit it, and case classification rules, see the [Data Submission Guide](data-submission-guide.md).

## Data Structure

Data should be submitted in CSV format with one row per unique combination of:

- Time period (week)
- Geographic unit
- Disease
- Age group (when applicable)
- Disease subtype (when applicable)
- Outcome (currently only cases)

<br>

### Field Summary

The following table provides a comprehensive overview of all data fields required for submission:

| Field Name | Data Type | Description | Valid Values | Required |
|------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| time_unit | String | Time aggregation unit | `week` | Yes |
| report_period_start | Date | Start date of reporting period (MMWR week aligned) | ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) | Yes |
| report_period_end | Date | End date of reporting period (MMWR week aligned) | ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) | Yes |
| date_type | String | Method used to assign cases to reporting periods | `cccd`, `jurisdiction date hierarchy` | Yes |
| disease_name | String | Name of disease being reported | `measles`, `pertussis`, `meningococcus` | Yes |
| outcome | String | Type of outcome being reported | `cases`, `hospitalizations`, `deaths` | Yes |
| confirmation_status | String | Case confirmation level | `confirmed`, `confirmed and probable` | Yes |
| reporting_jurisdiction | String | Jurisdiction submitting the data | Two-letter state/territory code or `NYC` | Yes |
| state | String | State/territory containing the geographic unit | Two-letter state/territory code | Yes |
| geo_unit | String | Type of geographic unit | `county`, `state`, `region`, `planning area`, `hsa`, `NA` | Yes |
| geo_name | String | Name of the geographic unit | Name string or `international resident`, `unknown`, `unspecified` | Yes |
| count | Integer | Number of cases for this combination | Positive integers | Yes |
| age_group | String | Age group of cases | `<1 y`, `1-4 y`, `5-11 y`, `12-18 y`, `19-22 y`, `23-44 y`, `45-64 y`, `>=65 y`, `total`, `unknown`, `unspecified` | Yes |
| disease_subtype | String | Disease subtype (meningococcal serogroup) | `A`, `B`, `C`, `W`, `X`, `Y`, `Z`, `total`, `unknown`, `unspecified` | Yes |
<br>

**Key Notes:**

- **Report Period:** Use MMWR week boundaries for weekly reporting
- **Disease-Specific Rules:** Measles uses `confirmed` only; Pertussis and Meningococcus use `confirmed and probable`
- **Geographic Units:** Use standard two-letter abbreviations (AL, AK, ..., WY, DC, PR, etc.); for international residents use `geo_name = "international resident"` and `geo_unit = "NA"`; for suppressed small counts use `geo_name = "unspecified"`
- **Age Groups:** Age groups displayed at jurisdiction level only (not sub-jurisdiction); use `total` for non-age-stratified aggregations
- **Disease Subtype:** Use `total` for non-subtype-stratified aggregations or diseases without subtype reporting (measles, pertussis); use `unknown` when subtyping was not performed; use `unspecified` when subtype is known but suppressed
- **Counts:** Only include non-zero counts; apply jurisdiction data suppression policies before submission

<br>

### No Zero Reporting

Only include rows with non-zero counts. The system will automatically infer zeros for missing combinations at higher aggregation levels.
<br>
<br>

## Validation

See [Validation](validation.md) for details on file and data validation.

<br>
<br>

## Example Data

Example data files are available to help understand the required format:

- [Complete example](https://github.com/USDiseaseTracker/USDiseaseTracker-Docs/blob/main/examples-and-templates/disease_tracking_report_CA-SIMULATED-EXAMPLE_2026-02-09.csv) - Sample data file with measles and pertussis data
- [Empty template](https://github.com/USDiseaseTracker/USDiseaseTracker-Docs/blob/main/examples-and-templates/disease_tracking_report_{jurisdiction}_{report_date}.csv) - Template file with correct structure
- [Data dictionary (CSV)](https://github.com/USDiseaseTracker/USDiseaseTracker-Docs/blob/main/examples-and-templates/disease_tracking_data_dictionary.csv) - Reference table of all fields and valid values

**File naming convention:**

Files should be named following the pattern:

```
disease_tracking_report_{jurisdiction}_{report_date}.csv
```

Examples:

- `disease_tracking_report_CA-SIMULATED-EXAMPLE_2026-02-09.csv` (California state, submitted February 9, 2026. These are partially simulated data and should not be assumed to be real data.)

<br>
<br>


## Metadata Requirements

Jurisdictions should provide accompanying metadata using the [Jurisdiction Reporting Metadata Template](https://github.com/USDiseaseTracker/USDiseaseTracker-Docs/blob/main/examples-and-templates/disease-tracking-metadata-{jurisdiction}.yaml). Metadata required includes:

1. **Date Classification Method**
   a. If using CCCD, indicate "cccd"
   b. If using custom hierarchy, provide detailed description

2. **Geographic Units**

   b. How suppressed counts are aggregated

4. **Contact Information**
   a. Technical point of contact
