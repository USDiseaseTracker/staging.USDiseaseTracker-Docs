## About The US Disease Tracker

The goal of the US Disease Tracker is to provide consolidated epidemiologically sound data, analytics, and insights for monitoring and responding to disease threats across the United States. This project aims to produce data that are as standardized as possible, while recognizing individual variations in how and when data are collected and made available to participating health departments.

### The USDiseaseTracker-Docs Repository

#### ***The USDiseaseTracker-Docs Repository***
This repository houses the data standards, templates, examples, and validation documentation for the US Disease Tracker. It provides a centralized location for standardized formats and guidelines for disease surveillance data. The goal of this repository is to establish the processes, standards, and data formats that will enable construction of a consolidated database and dashboard to track infectious diseases across the US in real-time. 

While we aim to limit changes once data standards and processes are established, they may change intermittently as this project evolves. All changes will be reflected and described here.
<br>
<br>


Our **Key Principles** are:

1. Provision of data is voluntary.
2. Only aggregate data will be collected to minimize the risk of reidentification.
3. Data should be updated and back-populated on a regular basis, acknowledging that recent data may be incomplete as investigations proceed. Records of prior versions will be maintained.
4. We do not suppress (except in accordance with individual jurisdiction policies, regulations, or laws) or manipulate data once received; jurisdictions should submit only data they are comfortable posting publicly.

## Data Validation

Data are validated upon submission for completeness, format, and errors. See the [Validation Rules](guides/validation.md) for detailed validation requirements. Data can be submitted to the dashboard at any time to check the validation.

To check what combinations of values are valid, check out the [USDT Data Standards Tool](https://usdiseasetracker.github.io/USDiseaseTracker-Docs/data-standards-tool/).
